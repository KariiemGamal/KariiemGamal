## 📦 My Projects

### 🔗 [0dSSRF: Collaborative SSRF & Open Redirect Scanner](https://github.com/KariiemGamal/0dSSRF)
**0dSSRF** is a powerful tool designed to automate the detection of **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** and **Open Redirect** vulnerabilities in web applications. Built to simplify the process for security professionals, the tool allows for multiple injection methods and comprehensive scanning. 

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Injection Methods**: Automate payload injections for Host Headers, Common Headers, Absolute URLs, and URL Parameters.
- **Resumable Scanning**: Continue interrupted scans with ease.
- **Structured Output & Logs**: Save and organize results in clean directories.
- **Flexible Rate-Limiting Control**: Adjust request rates for rate-limited environments.
  
Check out the detailed write-up on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@kariiem)** for more insights into how the tool works and how to leverage it in real-world pentests.
